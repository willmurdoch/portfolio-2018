                <h4>Delete 10 apps. Right now. They're hiding in rarely visited folders or buried on your phone's fourth page. Get rid of them.</h4>
                <h3>9 apps</h3>
                <p>The average number of applications a person uses every day.<sup>1</sup> Despite using only nine, the average person has nearly 100 apps on his or her phone.<sup>2</sup></p>
              </div>
              <div class="rCol">
                <h4>Getting Through the Day</h4>
                <p>You probably looked at each app on the chopping block and recalled fondly why you downloaded it. Whether you added it for one-time use, or in hopes that it would become part of your regular routine, now it's just hogging space from what you want to be doing. As you evaluate each, ask yourself: Have I opened this in the past 90 days? If you haven't, you know what to do.</p>
                <h4>What You'll Notice</h4>
                <p>Beyond the obvious storage space you just freed up, there's something more substantial: efficiency. Less mobile bloat means more mobile productivity. That could lead to a permanently streamlined device, or it could also just free up space for an app that fits your evolving interests.</p>
                <h4>Lasting Tips</h4>
                <p>Deleting 10 apps every day isn't sustainable, but being smart about what you add is. Two suggestions:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Set a monthly calendar alert to remind you to go through your phone and delete unused apps. </li>
                  <li>Get into the habit of deleting one app for every new app you download.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Say goodbye to color and put your phone in grayscale. Search for “Color Filter” on iPhone or “Color Adjustment” on Android, and toggle the color switch.</h4>
                <h3>300 feet</h3>

                <h4>Getting Through the Day</h4>
                <p>At first this might not seem like a big deal, but wait a few hours. Actually, just wait a few minutes. Color perception impacts excitement and attention levels, so as you look at a gray news feed or colorless game, those satisfying hits of dopamine are less frequent. Without color, the apps that you like to escape to aren't quite as stimulating.</p>
                <h4>What You'll Notice</h4>
                <p>You'll start using your phone in different ways: Mindless scrolling sessions will be replaced by purposeful apps such as email, text, and calendar—all of which are just as effective in black and white. Another bonus: Grayscale will probably help you cut down on insta-stalking your coworkers.</p>
                <h4>Lasting Tips</h4>
                <p>Tomorrow, as you reenter a world of color, consider these tips:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Recognize which apps weren't as enjoyable in grayscale, and move them to a folder on the third page of your phone.</li>
                  <li>Dim your screen brightness to help curb usage of the most captivating apps—and save some battery life. </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Getting Through the Day</h4>
                <p>Is anxiety already setting in? Are you worried that you're missing the “likes” on your photo? That's OK. Remember, you can still use your phone today, but now you'll look at it based on <em>your</em> schedule and <em>your</em> interests.</p>
                <h4>What You'll Notice</h4>
                <p>You've become trained to react to buzzes in your pocket, but on a day without notifications, you have the freedom to focus. You can now give your full attention to your kid's sandcastle, or that audiobook you've been trying to finish.</p>
                <h4>Lasting Tips</h4>
                <p>Tomorrow, as you slowly begin to turn back on essential alerts (we recommend reactivating a max of five), consider these tips to optimize your phone for focus:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Create custom Do Not Disturb times tailored to your schedule.</li>
                  <li>Android users can download a notification manager, such as AcDisplay, to help simplify and prioritize alerts.</li>
                  <li>Cut down on email alerts by turning off auto-sync.</li>

                <p>Most devices have built-in storage managers. Search your phone for that feature and be bold with what you delete. Remember that digital media is replaceable. That backlog of “new” music? That Netflix show you never got around to watching? These storage hogs can easily be redownloaded. And the important stuff? Your HD photos? Your years-long text chains? These can all be safely moved to the cloud, where you can revisit them whenever the urge strikes.</p>
                <h4>What You'll Notice</h4>
                <p>When you clear substantial amounts of clutter, you get something in return: peace of mind. There's nothing more frustrating than hitting your storage limit at the exact moment your cat does something adorable.</p>

                <p>Now that you cleared up some space, here's how to keep storage light:</p>

If the anxiety becomes too great, try writing out your to-do's on paper, so when you do check your phone, you know exactly what you need to take care of.</p>

                <p>By breaking up your hour into segments, you'll know exactly when to pay attention to your digital life and when to focus on your actual life. You might even realize that while multitasking feels more productive, it actually causes you to do multiple things less efficiently.</p>
                <h4>Lasting Tips</h4>
                <p>Here are some simple ways to avoid over-checking your phone:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Go to Pinterest and download a wallpaper with a message that keeps you focused.</li>
                  <li>Assign important contacts a specific vibration or ring to know which alerts are distractions and which aren't.</li>
                  <li>Add a productivity app, such as Forest, to help you avoid using your phone when you're supposed to be working.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Getting Through the Night</h4>
                <p>When was the last time you kept your phone out of bed? Tonight's challenge might seem unnatural for you, but our tired bodies do better without a screen so close to our face. The blue light from our screens blocks the production of melatonin, which we rely on to fall asleep.</p>
                <h4>What You'll Notice</h4>
                <p>Forcing yourself to sleep phone-free isn't just about the physical impact; doing so will also change your mindset. Without that temptation to endlessly swipe, those feelings of excitement, anxiety, and stress vanish. Instead, the focus is on deep, undisturbed rest. </p>
                <h4>Lasting Tips</h4>
                <p>So maybe you still want your phone nearby when you go to bed, but these tips can also help you sleep:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Turn on PM settings such as Night Shift or Night Mode to reduce blue light.</li>
                  <li>Download a presleep program—find one on an app like Calm—to help ease you into the night with meditation and relaxation techniques.</li>

                <h4>Getting Through the Day</h4>
                <p>First off, give your fingers a rest. A complete app reorg is like a marathon for your hands. As you acclimate to this minimalist layout, use the search bar to find what you need (swipe down on iPhone and swipe up on Android). Gone are the days of getting lost in an app wormhole and forgetting why you opened your phone in the first place.</p>
                <h4>What You'll Notice</h4>
                <p>Isn't an empty home screen refreshing? That once overwhelming page is now a place of simplicity. Or is there unease knowing that your favorite apps are all buried in the same folder? It's OK to feel that way. Today is about learning to live with an empty home screen.</p>
                <h4>Lasting Tips</h4>
                <p>Regardless of whether you keep your home screen clear, you should have a system to organize all your apps. Here are two that we like:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Categorical - Create a system of folders based on your preference. Organize them according to what each app does (e.g., entertain, communicate, share, etc.) or just simply arrange them alphabetically.</li>
                  <li>Rainbow - Organize by colors. You'll be amazed at how well your brain recalls the color of your favorite apps.</li>

      <h2>A Word From Our Expert</h2>
      <p>"I'm a lover of all things tech. And as a productivity consultant for 12-plus years, I'm always on the lookout for digital tools that help my clients get more done. At times, though, tech can be a double-edged sword—especially when it comes to smartphones. As you spend more time interacting with your phone and the apps that come with it, you might spend less time focused on the things you enjoy.
      <br /><br />
      But is there a way to reboot your relationship with your device so you can be more aware of the way you use it? What if you could make it a more effective tool? That's where the Phone Cleanse comes in. The cleanse shares simple ways to both unclutter your device and transform the way you use it. Take on each day's challenge and you'll quickly find yourself feeling less distracted. Then with a fresh perspective on your mobile habits, you'll be ready to fall in love with your (organized) phone again."</p>
