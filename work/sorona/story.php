						<h2>Sew the seeds<br>of change</h2>
						<p>We believe science should learn from nature—that a product is timeless when it’s renewable and that a single fiber can make a world of difference.  We know that we never have to sacrifice performance to be sustainable, or the other way around. To us, finding ways to leave a smaller footprint just comes naturally, so we do it every step of the way.</p>

				<h3>Renew your<br>world</h3>
				<p>When we spot a hint of greatness, we give it a second look. We explore untapped possibilities and find a way to make it something truly special. This is how, after decades of research and asking the right questions, DuPont scientists discovered a way to produce PDO—a building block with endlessly versatile potential—using a biological process that would have a global impact:</p>

						<h2>Leave the legacy you design</h2>
						<p>Ever since the early 1900s, DuPont has been revolutionizing the world of fiber and polymers. From the first plastic-coated fabrics developed in the 1910s to groundbreaking fibers like the versatile nylon, neoprene rubber fabric, elastic Lycra®, bulletproof Kevlar® and even Tyvek®, DuPont has spent over a century creating textile products that transform the way we live and work. And as a product that’s on the forefront of the shift from oil-based materials to bio-based ones, Sorona<sup>&reg;</sup> fits perfectly into a legacy of meaningful performance-based innovation — one that we have to continue to sustain our world.</p>
